### üèóÔ∏è **Technical Architecture**
- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS, React Router, Context API
- **Backend**: Flask API with PostgreSQL, JWT authentication, RESTful design
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with 8 main tables and relationships
- **Security**: CORS, rate limiting, input validation, JWT tokens

### üìÅ **File-by-File Breakdown**
- **Backend files**: 30+ Python files explained in detail
- **Frontend files**: 50+ React/JavaScript files explained
- **Configuration files**: Docker, deployment, build tools
- **Purpose of each file**: What it does and why it exists

### üîç **Code Analysis**
- **Line-by-line explanations** for critical files
- **Function purposes** and how they work together
- **Database models** and their relationships
- **API endpoints** and their functionality

## üí¨ 2. INLINE COMMENTS IN EVERY FILE

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - All files processed

### üêç **Python Files (Backend) - 35+ files commented**
Every Python file now has detailed comments explaining:
- **Import statements**: What each library does and why it's needed
- **Class definitions**: Purpose of each database model and schema
- **Function definitions**: What each function does and its parameters
- **Variable assignments**: What data is being stored and why
- **Decorators**: Route definitions and authentication requirements
- **Control structures**: Logic flow and decision making

**Example from `backend/app.py`:**
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request  # Flask: main app class, jsonify: JSON responses, request: HTTP request data
from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager, jwt_required  # JWT token management for user authentication
from flask_cors import CORS  # Cross-Origin Resource Sharing - allows frontend to connect to backend

app = Flask(__name__)  # Flask application instance

@jwt.token_in_blocklist_loader  # JWT token blacklist checker - prevents use of revoked tokens after logout
def check_if_token_revoked(jwt_header, jwt_payload):  # Check if a JWT token has been revoked (blacklisted) after logout
    from auth.models import RevokedTokenModel  # Import token blacklist model
    return RevokedTokenModel.is_jti_blacklisted(jwt_payload["jti"])  # Check if token ID is blacklisted
```

### ‚öõÔ∏è **JavaScript/React Files (Frontend) - 50+ files commented**
Every JavaScript/JSX file now has detailed comments explaining:
- **Import statements**: React components, libraries, and services
- **Component definitions**: UI component purposes and functionality
- **Hook usage**: React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.)
- **Event handlers**: User interaction handling
- **API calls**: Communication with backend services
- **State management**: How data flows through components

**Example from `frontend/src/App.jsx`:**
```javascript
import React from "react";  // React library import
import { Routes, Route, Navigate, useLocation, useNavigate} from "react-router-dom";  // React Router for navigation
import AuthService from "./services/auth.service";  // Service layer import for API communication

function PrivateRoute({ children }) {  // Higher-order component for protected routes
  const auth = AuthService.getCurrentUser()  // Check if user is authenticated
  return auth ? children : <Navigate to="/login" />;  // Redirect to login if not authenticated
}

function App() {  // Main application component
  const navigate = useNavigate();  // React Router hook for programmatic navigation
```
